### Abstract
This repository contains a map image of counties in Missouri, colored by their 2016 estimated low birth weight births as a percentage of the total number of live births. These data were obtained from the County Health Ranks 2016 data release for Missouri. I use this map for teaching about low birth weight (part of the gender section of the course).
